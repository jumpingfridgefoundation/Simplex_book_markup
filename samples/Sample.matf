p:The struggle that our people waged for over seven and a half years was not merely for the removal of an occupier, but for the full, complete restoration of our national dignity and sovereignty. We are here today, not as a gift from any power, but as a result of the unyielding sacrifice of our martyrs and the unshakable will of a nation.>

p:We look out upon a world still grappling with the shadows of colonialism and injustice. Let it be known: the liberty of Algeria is inseparable from the liberty of all oppressed peoples. Our victory is but one chapter in a greater history of global emancipation.>

p:We extend our hands in solidarity to those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who continue their fight. We shall never forget that the chains binding one are a threat to the freedom of all. Algeria, the land of one and a half million martyrs, stands ready to contribute its experience, its voice, and its heart to the building of a world based on justice, equality, and peace.>
